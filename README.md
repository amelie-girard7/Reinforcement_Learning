## Introduction

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a dynamic and versatile paradigm within the machine learning domain that goes beyond the traditional confines of supervised learning. Unlike supervised learning, where models are trained on a fixed dataset with clearly defined correct answers, RL thrives in scenarios where the optimal outcomes are not known beforehand. Instead, RL trains models, known as agents, through direct interaction with their environment. The agent learns by exploring different actions, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, and iteratively adjusting its strategies to maximize long-term success.

The core distinction between reinforcement learning and more common predictive machine learning lies in the data availability and learning process. In predictive machine learning, a vast amount of data is typically available, which is used to train a model that can then make predictions or answer questions. However, in reinforcement learning, there is no initial dataset; instead, the agent must generate its own data by interacting with the environment. The agent navigates through this environment, collecting rewards and penalties, thereby creating the data it needs to learn and improve its decision-making process.

![Reinforcement_Learning](img/rl.PNG)

This course places a strong emphasis on the practical applications of RL, particularly in the domain of **counterfactual story rewriting**. Throughout this course, we will delve into several critical reinforcement learning concepts. We will start by exploring the Markov Decision Process (MDP), the fundamental framework that underpins RL. Next, we will study the Bellman equation, a key component in reinforcement learning that helps in evaluating the optimal strategies. As we progress, we will examine how neural networks can enhance reinforcement learning, especially when dealing with complex problems. This will include an in-depth look at Q-networks and policy gradients, which are instrumental in scaling RL to real-world applications.

## Deep Reinforcement Learning

### 2.1. Markov Decision Processes (MDP)

The **Markov Decision Process (MDP)** is the fundamental framework in reinforcement learning. A great way to illustrate an MDP is by using the **grid world** example.

![gridworld](img/gridworld.PNG)

In this grid-based universe, the agent (represented by a circle) moves across various squares (states). Some squares contain valuable rewards, while others hold penalties. For example:
- The top right square contains a rare alien artifact, offering a significant reward (+5 points).
- The third square from the top left is a refueling station, providing a smaller reward (+4 points).
- The bottom right square is a dangerous black hole, resulting in a penalty (-1 point).

To make this more interesting, the agent can earn or lose points by landing on these specific squares. Each square is considered a **terminal state**, meaning the game ends when the agent lands there, and the collected points are added to the agent’s total. Certain squares also act as barriers, and the agent cannot pass through them. The agent must navigate the grid, aiming to maximize the points collected.

For example:
- If the agent lands on a +4 square, it collects 4 points.
- If the agent lands on a -1 square, it loses 1 point.
- The agent can start from any square and try to find the best strategy for collecting the most points.

The aim of reinforcement learning is to teach the agent to perform as well as possible. To do this, let’s consider the neighbors of a specific square:

![valuep](img/valuep.PNG)

Each square in the grid represents a **state**, and the agent can choose from four possible actions: up, down, left, or right. The neighboring squares have values that represent potential rewards or penalties. For instance:
- Moving right gives +4 points.
- Moving up gives +1 point.
- Moving left subtracts 3 points.
- Moving down provides +2 points.

The best strategy for the agent is to move in the direction that maximizes rewards. In this case, it would move right and gain 4 points.

This idea is captured by the **Bellman Equation**, which states that the value of a state is the maximum reward that can be achieved by moving to one of its neighboring states. The agent should always choose the action that leads to the highest possible reward. The policy, which we’ll discuss soon, defines the best actions for the agent to take based on the state it is in.

Initially, only the terminal states (e.g., +5, +4, and -1) have known values. The Bellman Equation helps propagate these values to neighboring states:

![valuep5](img/valuep5.PNG)

As a result, each state receives a value based on the best decision the agent can make from that state. In this example, every state eventually leads to the +5 reward.

#### Policies
A **policy** is a strategy that directs the agent on which actions to take. You can think of it as arrows on the grid pointing the agent toward the best possible actions to maximize rewards. 

A good policy ensures that the agent avoids penalties and navigates efficiently toward high-reward states. The following diagram shows a simple policy:

![valuep5o](img/valuep5o.PNG)

This policy, while functional, could be optimized to help the agent reach the +5 reward more quickly. By refining the policy, the agent can avoid inefficient routes and reach rewards faster.

### 2.2. Rewards

In reinforcement learning, **rewards** play a crucial role in guiding the agent’s behavior. To prevent the agent from wandering aimlessly, we can assign a small penalty for each step the agent takes. This encourages the agent to minimize the number of steps it takes to reach terminal states.

![reward](img/reward.PNG)

For example, let’s assume each step costs the agent 1 point. Now, the agent must balance collecting rewards while minimizing steps to maximize its overall score. This introduces a small modification to the Bellman Equation.

![reward1](img/reward1.PNG)

Incorporating a penalty for each step motivates the agent to find the shortest path to high-reward states. This modification adjusts the value of each state and encourages the agent to be more efficient in its decision-making.

### 2.3. Discount Factor

The **discount factor (gamma)** is an essential concept in reinforcement learning. It reflects the idea that immediate rewards are worth more than future rewards. The discount factor encourages the agent to prioritize actions that lead to quicker rewards rather than delayed ones.

![discountfactor](img/discountfactor.PNG)

For instance, a reward of +4 in the future might be worth only 3.6 points now if the discount factor is 0.9. This helps the agent prefer immediate rewards while still considering future benefits.

The Bellman Equation is updated to account for this discount factor, adjusting the value of each state accordingly.

![discountfactor2](img/discountfactor2.PNG)

By introducing the discount factor, the agent is encouraged to take actions that maximize short-term rewards while still considering the potential for future gains.

![discountfactor3](img/discountfactor3.PNG)

### 2.4. Bellman Equation

The **Bellman Equation** combines the concepts of rewards and the discount factor. It calculates the value of each state by considering both immediate rewards and the discounted value of future rewards. The equation ensures that the agent always makes decisions that maximize long-term rewards.

![bellman](img/bellman.PNG)

For example, if the agent moves to the right and expects a reward of 4 points, the Bellman Equation discounts that future reward and calculates the current state’s value accordingly. The goal is for the agent to always choose actions that lead to the highest cumulative reward.

### 2.5. Solving the Bellman Equation

To solve the Bellman Equation, the agent must iteratively update the value of each state based on the rewards and values of neighboring states. This process continues until the values converge and stabilize.

![solve bellman](img/solvebellman.PNG)

By applying the Bellman Equation to all states repeatedly, the agent propagates the rewards throughout the grid. Eventually, the values of all states become optimal, allowing the agent to make the best decisions in any situation.

![solve bellman](img/solvebellman1.PNG)
In larger environments, solving the Bellman Equation can be computationally challenging, but it provides a structured way for the agent to learn the optimal strategy.

### 2.6. Deterministic vs Stochastic Processes

In reinforcement learning, there are two types of policies: **deterministic** and **stochastic**. A **deterministic policy** always selects the same action in a given state, while a **stochastic policy** introduces some randomness, allowing the agent to explore different options.

![deterministic vs stochastic](img/determvsstoch.PNG)

For example, a deterministic policy may consistently guide the agent toward a known reward, but it risks missing out on other potential rewards in unexplored areas. A stochastic policy gives the agent some flexibility to explore different paths, possibly discovering better rewards.

![deterministic vs stochastic policy](img/determvsstoch1.PNG)

A **stochastic policy** enables the agent to balance between exploiting known rewards and exploring new areas for potential rewards. This balance is crucial for training the agent effectively in complex environments.

![deterministic vs stochastic policy2](img/determvsstoch2.PNG)

### 2.7. Neural Networks

As environments become more complex, solving reinforcement learning problems explicitly with the Bellman Equation becomes computationally expensive. **Neural networks** are used to approximate the value of states and actions, allowing the agent to generalize its knowledge and apply it to new, unseen situations.

![Neural Networks](img/nn.PNG)

A **value neural network** predicts the value of each state, while a **policy neural network** predicts the best action to take in each state. These networks help the agent efficiently navigate larger environments.

### 2.8. Value Neural Networks

A **value neural network** (or **Q-network**) approximates the value of states based on the agent’s experience. Instead of calculating the exact value for each state, the network learns from past interactions and propagates the learned values to other states.

![Neural Networks Value](img/valuenn.PNG)

The Bellman Equation serves as the basis for training the network. The agent updates the network by adjusting its weights based on the rewards and values of neighboring states.

![Neural Networks Value1](img/valuenn1.PNG)

Once the value network is trained, it can predict the value of any state, allowing the agent to make decisions without needing to visit every possible state.

### 2.9. Policy Neural Networks

**Policy networks** directly predict the best action to take in each state without estimating the value of the state. This approach can speed up decision-making in environments where calculating state values is too complex or time-consuming.

![Neural Networks Policy](img/nn-policy.PNG)

The policy network outputs probabilities for each possible action, allowing the agent to choose actions based on learned patterns.

### 2.10. Training the Policy Neural Network

Training a **policy network** involves learning from the agent’s experiences and adjusting the action probabilities to maximize rewards. The network is updated based on the gains or losses associated with each action.

![Training Policy](img/trainpolicy.PNG)

If the agent takes an action that leads to a high reward, the network increases the probability of selecting that action in the future. Conversely, actions that lead to poor outcomes are less likely to be chosen.

By continuously refining the policy network, the agent becomes more efficient at selecting the best actions while still allowing room for exploration.

## 3. Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF)

### 3.1. How Does RLHF Work?

RLHF works by integrating human feedback into the model's training process. The model is refined iteratively based on this feedback, resulting in outputs that better align with human expectations.

- **Conceptual Overview**: The RLHF process involves training a model by iteratively adjusting its outputs based on human preferences. Human labelers review model outputs and indicate which ones align more closely with the desired outcomes.

- **Example Task - Text Summarization**: Consider a model designed to summarize news articles. Initially, the model might produce several summaries that are technically correct but vary in quality. Human evaluators review these summaries and select the ones that best capture the most critical aspects of the article. For instance, if the article is about a new scientific discovery, the preferred summary might focus on the discovery's implications rather than the technical details.

### 3.2. Datasets for RLHF

Successful RLHF implementation depends on well-prepared datasets. The following are essential:

1. **Preference Dataset**: Contains pairs of input texts and multiple model-generated outputs, along with labels indicating human preferences. This dataset is used to train the reward model.

    - **Example**: In the context of text summarization, the dataset might include a research paper followed by several different summaries, with labels indicating which summary better captures the key findings and conclusions.

2. **Prompt Dataset**: A collection of prompts used to generate outputs from the LLM during fine-tuning.

    - **Example**: For autocompletion tasks, prompts could be the beginning of a sentence like "The economic impact of the pandemic has been..." that the model needs to complete in a coherent and contextually appropriate manner.

3. **Data Preparation**: Ensure that datasets are formatted in JSON Lines and stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS). Proper data organization is crucial for smooth training operations.

### 3.3. Tuning an LLM with RLHF

#### Model Training Approaches

1. **Supervised Fine-Tuning**:
    - This approach involves training a model on a labeled dataset where each input is paired with a desired output. The goal is to teach the model the relationship between inputs and outputs.
    - **Data Format**: `{input text, summary}`
    - **Example**: Suppose the input is a detailed report on climate change. The desired output might be a summary that highlights the most urgent findings and recommendations, which the model learns to produce through supervised training.

2. **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**:
    - RLHF incorporates human feedback into the training process, allowing the model to learn from subjective preferences rather than just correct/incorrect labels.
    - **Data Format**: `{input text, summary 1, summary 2, human preference}`
    - **Example**: Given an input text describing a political event, the model generates multiple summaries. Human evaluators might prefer a summary that emphasizes the event's impact on international relations rather than internal politics. The model is then fine-tuned to produce more summaries that align with these preferences.

One challenge in RLHF is the variability in human preferences, which can differ between individuals. However, by aggregating feedback from multiple evaluators, the model can learn a general preference pattern.

![How does it work](img/how.PNG)
*// This image visualizes the basic workflow of RLHF, showing how human feedback guides the model towards more desirable outputs.*


### 3.4. Evaluating the Tuned Model

Evaluation is critical to ensure that the tuned model meets performance expectations:

- **Evaluation Metrics**: Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, alongside human evaluation, to assess model performance.
- **Validation Process**: Run the model on a separate validation dataset and compare the outputs with human-preferred outcomes.
- **Iterative Improvement**: Based on evaluation results, further tuning may be necessary. This process is iterative and continues until the model’s performance is satisfactory.

- **Example**: In evaluating a model trained for text summarization, you might find that while the model is good at brevity, it occasionally omits critical information. Based on this insight, you would further fine-tune the model to balance conciseness with completeness.

Refer to the [L4_evaluate_model.ipynb](src/L4/L4_evaluate_model.ipynb).


### 3.5. Google Cloud Setup

Setting up the RLHF pipeline on Google Cloud involves several steps:

- **Google Cloud Storage**: Store datasets in GCS buckets, ensuring proper organization and accessibility. Datasets should be in JSON Lines format.
- **Vertex AI Configuration**: Vertex AI pipelines are configured using YAML files, defining steps and parameters for the training process. This allows for scalable and automated model training and deployment.
- **Execution Best Practices**: Start with smaller datasets to validate pipeline functionality before scaling up. Use tools like TensorBoard to monitor training progress.

Refer to the [L5_google_cloud_setup.ipynb](src/L5/L5_google_cloud_setup.ipynb).

## Annex of Reinforcement Learning: Key Concepts and Techniques

**Reinforcement Learning (RL)** is a machine learning paradigm where an **agent** learns to make decisions by interacting with an **environment** to achieve a specific **goal**. The agent takes **actions** based on the current **state** of the environment and receives **rewards** as feedback, which it uses to learn and improve its decision-making policy over time.

### 6.1. Key Terminology

1. **Environment (E)**: The external system with which the agent interacts.
   - **Example**: In counterfactual story rewriting, the environment is the narrative context that includes the characters, plot, and setting of the story.

2. **State (s)**: A specific situation or configuration of the environment at a given time.
   - **Example**: The state could be the current draft of the story at a particular point in the narrative, including characters, plot points, and stylistic elements.

3. **Action (a)**: A decision or move made by the agent that affects the state of the environment.
   - **Example**: Altering a plot point in a story rewrite to align with a counterfactual event while minimizing unnecessary changes.

4. **Reward (r)**: A scalar feedback signal received after taking an action, indicating the desirability of the outcome.
   - **Example**: A positive reward when a story rewrite successfully integrates a counterfactual event with minimal disruption to the original narrative; a negative reward if the story loses coherence or deviates too much from its original form.

5. **Policy (π)**: The strategy employed by the agent to decide which action to take.
   - **Deterministic Policy**: Always selects the same action for a given state.

     $$a = \pi(s)$$

   - **Stochastic Policy**: Selects actions based on a probability distribution.

     $$\pi(a|s) = P(a|s)$$

### 6.2. Key Assumptions

1. **Action Influences Measurement**: The agent’s actions directly influence the state of the environment.
2. **Markov Decision Process (MDP) Framework**: RL problems are framed as MDPs where the decision-making process is modeled using states, actions, and rewards.
3. **Rewards and Cumulative Rewards**: The agent's goal is to maximize the cumulative reward over time.
4. **Infinite Horizon and Discounted Cumulative Reward**: Future rewards are discounted to prevent infinite values.
5. **Application to Finite Horizons**: Discounted rewards can also apply in finite-horizon problems, balancing immediate and long-term benefits.

### 6.3. Core Concepts and Mathematical Foundations

#### **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**

An MDP provides a mathematical framework for decision-making, defined by a tuple $(S, A, P, R, \gamma)$.

#### **Bellman Equations**

Provide recursive definitions for the value functions.

#### **Policy Optimization Techniques**

- **Value Iteration**: Iteratively updates the value function.
- **Policy Iteration**: Alternates between policy evaluation and policy improvement steps.
- **Q-Learning**: A model-free method that learns the optimal policy by estimating the optimal Q-values.
- **Policy Gradient Methods**: Directly optimize the policy by following the gradient of expected rewards.

**Example**: Using policy gradients in counterfactual story rewriting to adjust the model parameters $(\theta$) for generating more contextually appropriate narrative adjustments based on user feedback.
